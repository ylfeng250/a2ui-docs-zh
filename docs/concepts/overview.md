# Core Concepts

This section explains the fundamental architecture of A2UI. Understanding these concepts will help you build effective agent-driven interfaces.

See [Glossary](../glossary.md) for short definitions of key terms.

## The Big Picture

A2UI is built around three core ideas:

1. **Streaming Messages**: UI updates flow as a sequence of JSON messages from agent to client
2. **Declarative Components**: UIs are described as data, not programmed as code
3. **Data Binding**: UI structure is separate from application state, enabling reactive updates

## Key Topics

### [Data Flow](data-flow.md)
How messages travel from agents to rendered UI. Includes a complete lifecycle example of a restaurant booking flow, transport options (SSE, WebSockets, A2A), progressive rendering, and error handling.

### [Component Structure](components.md)
A2UI's **adjacency list model** for representing component hierarchies. Learn why flat lists are better than nested trees, how to use static vs. dynamic children, and best practices for incremental updates.

### [Data Binding](data-binding.md)
How components connect to application state using JSON Pointer paths. Covers reactive components, dynamic lists, input bindings, and the separation of structure from state that makes A2UI powerful.

## Message Types

=== "v0.8 (Stable)"

    Version 0.8 uses the following message types:

    - **`surfaceUpdate`**: Define or update UI components
    - **`dataModelUpdate`**: Update application state
    - **`beginRendering`**: Signal the client to render
    - **`deleteSurface`**: Remove a UI surface

=== "v0.9 (Draft)"

    Version 0.9 uses the following message types:

    - **`createSurface`**: Create a new surface and specify its catalog
    - **`updateComponents`**: Add or update UI components in a surface
    - **`updateDataModel`**: Update application state
    - **`deleteSurface`**: Remove a UI surface

    v0.9 separates surface creation from rendering — `createSurface` replaces both `beginRendering` and the implicit surface creation in `surfaceUpdate`. All messages include a `version` field.
