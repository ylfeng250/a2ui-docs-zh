# MCP Apps Integration in A2UI Surfaces

This guide explains how **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Applications** are integrated and displayed within the **A2UI** surface, along with the security model and testing guidelines.

> NOTE: Looking for the core A2UI-over-MCP protocol? See [A2UI over MCP](a2ui_over_mcp.md) for how to return A2UI JSON payloads from MCP tool calls.

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows MCP servers to deliver rich, interactive HTML-based user interfaces to hosts. A2UI provides a secure environment to run these third-party applications.

## Double-Iframe Isolation Pattern

To run untrusted third-party code securely, A2UI utilizes a **double-iframe** isolation pattern. This approach isolates raw DOM injection from the main application while maintaining a structured JSON-RPC channel.

### Security Rationale

Standard single-iframe sandboxing with `allow-scripts` is often bypassed if combined with `allow-same-origin`, which defeats the containerization. Any iframe with `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin` can escape its sandbox by programmatically interacting with its parent DOM or removing its own sandbox attribute.

To prevent this, A2UI strictly excludes `allow-same-origin` for the inner iframe where the third-party application runs.

### The Architecture

1.  **[Sandbox Proxy (`sandbox.html`)](https://github.com/google/A2UI/blob/main/samples/client/shared/mcp_apps_inner_iframe/sandbox.html)**: An intermediate `iframe` served from the same origin. It isolates raw DOM injection from the main app while maintaining a structured JSON-RPC channel.
    -   Permissions: **Do not sandbox** in the host template (e.g., [`mcp-app.ts`](https://github.com/google/A2UI/blob/main/samples/client/angular/projects/mcp_calculator/src/a2ui-catalog/mcp-app.ts) or [`mcp-apps-component.ts`](https://github.com/google/A2UI/blob/main/samples/client/lit/custom-components-example/ui/custom-components/mcp-apps-component.ts)).
    -   Host origin validation: Validates that messages come from the expected host origin.
2.  **Embedded App (Inner Iframe)**: The innermost `iframe`. Injected dynamically via `srcdoc` with restricted permissions.
    -   Permissions: `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-modals"` (**MUST NOT** include `allow-same-origin`).
    -   Isolation: Removes access to `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `IndexedDB`, and cookies due to unique origin.

    end
```

## Usage / Code Example

The MCP Apps component typically resolves to a `custom` node in the A2UI catalog. Here is how a developer might use it in their code.

### 1. Register within the Catalog

You must register the component in your catalog application. For example, in Angular:

```typescript
import { Catalog } from '@a2ui/angular';
import { inputBinding } from '@angular/core';

export const DEMO_CATALOG = {
  McpApp: {
    type: () => import('./mcp-app').then((r) => r.McpApp),
    bindings: ({ properties }) => [
      inputBinding(
        'content',
        () => ('content' in properties && properties['content']) || undefined,
      ),
      inputBinding('title', () => ('title' in properties && properties['title']) || undefined),
    ],
  },
} as Catalog;
```

### 2. Usage in A2UI Message

In the Host or Agent context, send an A2UI message that translates to this custom node.

```json
{
  "type": "custom",
  "name": "McpApp",
  "properties": {
    "content": "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>",
    "title": "My MCP App"
  }
}
```

If the content is complex or requires encoding, you can pass a URL-encoded string:

```json
{
  "type": "custom",
  "name": "McpApp",
  "properties": {
    "content": "url_encoded:%3Ch1%3EHello%2C%20World!%3C%2Fh1%3E",
    "title": "My MCP App"
  }
}
```

## Communication Protocol

Communication between the Host and the embedded inner iframe is facilitated via a structured JSON-RPC channel over `postMessage`.

-   **Events**: The Host Component listens for a `SANDBOX_PROXY_READY_METHOD` message from the proxy.
-   **Bridging**: An `AppBridge` handles message relaying. Developers (specifically the MCP App Developer inside the untrusted iframe) can call tools on the MCP server using `bridge.callTool()`.
-   **The Host**: Resolves callbacks (e.g., specific resizing, Tool results).

### Limitations

Because `allow-same-origin` is strictly omitted for the innermost iframe, the following conditions apply:
-   The MCP app **cannot** use `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `IndexedDB`, or cookies. Each application runs with a unique origin.
-   Direct DOM manipulation by the parent is blocked. All interactions must proceed via message passing.

## Prerequisites

To run the samples, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Python 3.10+** — Required for the agent and MCP server backends
-   **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — Fast Python package manager (used to run all Python samples)
-   **Node.js 18+** and **npm** — Required for building and running the client apps
-   **A `GEMINI_API_KEY`** — Required by all ADK-based agents. Get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

> ⚠️ **Environment variable setup**: You can either export `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your shell or create a `.env` file in each agent directory. The agents use `dotenv` to load `.env` files automatically.
>
> ```bash
> # Option 1: Export in shell
> export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
>
> # Option 2: Create .env file in the agent directory
> echo 'GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here' > .env
> ```

## Samples

There are two primary samples demonstrating MCP Apps integration. Each sample requires running **multiple terminals** — one for each backend service and one for the client.

---

### 1. MCP App Standalone Sample (Lit & ADK Agent)

This sample verifies the sandbox with a Lit-based client and an ADK-based A2A agent.

-   **A2A Agent Server**:
    -   Path: [`samples/agent/adk/mcp-apps-in-a2ui-sample/`](https://github.com/google/A2UI/tree/main/samples/agent/adk/mcp-apps-in-a2ui-sample/)
    -   Command: `uv run .` (requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`)
-   **Lit Client App**:
    -   Path: [`samples/client/lit/mcp-apps-in-a2ui-sample/`](https://github.com/google/A2UI/tree/main/samples/client/lit/mcp-apps-in-a2ui-sample/)
    -   Command: `npm install && npm run dev` (requires building the Lit renderer first)
    -   URL: `http://localhost:5173/`

**What to expect**: A simple interface loading the MCP App, with a button to trigger an action handled by the agent.

### 2. MCP Apps (Calculator + Pong) (Angular)

#### Step 3: Open in Browser

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`. You should see the A2UI interface loading the MCP App.

**What to expect**: A page loading the MCP App in a sandboxed iframe. Clicking the "Call Agent Tool" button inside the iframe will trigger an action that is handled by the agent.

---

### Sample 2: MCP Apps (Calculator + Pong) (Angular Client + MCP Server + Proxy Agent)

This sample verifies the sandbox with an Angular-based client, an MCP Proxy Agent, and a remote MCP Server. It requires **three** backend processes.

#### Step 1: Start the MCP Server (Calculator)

```bash
cd samples/agent/mcp/mcp-apps-calculator/
uv run .
```
=======
```bash
cd samples/client/lit/mcp-apps-in-a2ui-sample
npm install
npm run dev
```

The client starts at `http://localhost:5173/`.

#### Step 2: Start the Agent

In a separate terminal, navigate to the agent directory and start the agent:

```bash
cd samples/agent/adk/mcp-apps-in-a2ui-sample
uv run agent.py
```

The agent will run on `http://localhost:8000`.

#### Step 3: Open in Browser

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`. You should see the A2UI interface loading the MCP App.

**What to expect**: A page loading the MCP App in a sandboxed iframe. Clicking the "Call Agent Tool" button inside the iframe will trigger an action that is handled by the agent.

---

### Sample 2: MCP Apps (Calculator + Pong) (Angular Client + MCP Server + Proxy Agent)

This sample verifies the sandbox with an Angular-based client, an MCP Proxy Agent, and a remote MCP Server. It requires **three** backend processes.

#### Step 1: Start the MCP Server (Calculator)

```bash
cd samples/agent/mcp/mcp-apps-calculator/
uv run .
```
>>>>>>> e3c17f1f (docs: add npm install step to MCP guide)

The MCP server starts on `http://localhost:8000` using SSE transport.

#### Step 2: Start the MCP Apps Proxy Agent

In a **new terminal**:

```bash
cd samples/agent/adk/mcp_app_proxy/
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"  # or use a .env file
uv run .
```

The proxy agent starts on `http://localhost:10006` by default.

#### Step 3: Build and Start the Angular Client

In a **new terminal**:

```bash
cd samples/client/angular/

# Build the renderers (required — Angular depends on local renderer packages)
npm run build:renderer

npm install --include=dev
npm run build:sandbox
npm start -- mcp_calculator
```

> ⚠️ **`--include=dev` is required**: The Angular CLI (`@angular/cli`) is a dev dependency. Without `--include=dev`, `ng serve` won't be available.
>
> ⚠️ **`build:renderer` and `build:sandbox` are both required**: `build:renderer` compiles the A2UI renderer packages that the Angular app depends on. `build:sandbox` bundles the sandbox proxy into the Angular project's public assets. Without either, the app won't work.

The client starts at `http://localhost:4200/`.

#### Step 4: Open in Browser

Navigate to:

```
http://localhost:4200/?disable_security_self_test=true
```

**What to expect**: A set of smart chips to load calculator app or pong app will be rendered. Both apps run in their own sandboxed iframes.

## URL Options for Testing

For testing purposes, you can opt-out of the security self-test by using specific URL query parameters.

### `disable_security_self_test=true`

This query parameter allows you to bypass the security self-test that verifies iframe isolation. This is useful for debugging and testing environments where the double-iframe setup may not pass strict origin checks (e.g., `localhost` development).

Example usage:
```
http://localhost:4200/?disable_security_self_test=true
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable not set` | Export the key or add a `.env` file in the agent directory |
| Python version error on `contact_lookup` agent | Install Python 3.13+ (required by that sample's `pyproject.toml`) |
| `npm run build:renderer` fails | Make sure you ran `npm install` first in `samples/client/lit/` |
| Angular client shows blank page | Ensure you ran `npm run build:sandbox` before `npm start` |
| MCP app iframe doesn't load | Check that both the MCP server (port 8000) and proxy agent (port 10006) are running |
| `ng serve` not found | Run `npm install --include=dev` to install dev dependencies including `@angular/cli` |
| "URL with hostname not allowed" | Angular 21 restricts allowed hosts. Use `localhost` (the default) — do not pass `--host 0.0.0.0` |
| Security self-test fails in dev | Add `?disable_security_self_test=true` to the URL |
